 <font style="font-weight:bold"> 3.Tables-- </font>

Tables are a convenient way to arrange the text and objects in the browser window. For scientific pages, they are an essential tool. Note that the original browsers (including early versions of Netscape and Internet Explorer) had little or no ability to format tables.

 <font style="font-weight:bold">3. Images-- </font>

Images can be displayed within the document. It is possible to display certain types of image in the browser window. The browser can typically load an external viewer to display images it cannot cope with. The most common image types are GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) and JPEG (Joint Photographic Expert Group). JPEG is better for photographs and GIF is better for line drawings. Modern browsers will be able to deal with both formats directly without invoking "application programs" or "helpers".
